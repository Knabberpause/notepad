This piece of software is a simple notepad that can do everything any other software can do.
It can save text files, have up to 3 pads open simeaultaneously, and one opened text file up on it.

This project is being constantly worked on, so you can expect regular updates. My Developer log for this project is inside the Wiki page.

It is built using Python and the Tkinter library.
Latest release: 2.4 (14/7/22)
